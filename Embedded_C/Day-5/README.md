The program includes two header files: avr/io.h for I/O port access and util/delay.h for delay functions.

Three pins on PORTD are defined for LEDs:

PD2 is defined as LED_PIN

PD5 is defined as LED_PIN1

PD7 is defined as LED_PIN2

In the main function:

The DDRD register is used to set PD2, PD5, and PD7 as output pins by setting their corresponding bits to 1.

First LED sequence:

The LED connected to PD2 is turned ON by setting its bit in PORTD.

A 500 ms delay is applied.

Then the LED is turned OFF by clearing its bit.

Second LED sequence:

The LED connected to PD5 is initially turned OFF.

After a 500 ms delay, it is turned ON.

Infinite blinking loop:

The LED connected to PD7 is toggled ON and OFF continuously using the XOR operator.

Each toggle is followed by a 500 ms delay, creating a blinking effect.
