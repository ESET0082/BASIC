Simple Counter with Reusable Button
Create a reusable Button component that accepts two props: label and onClick.
In App, display a count that starts at 0 and two buttons: Increment and Decrement.
Log each click to the console using console.log so it can be seen in Browser DevTools.

Clicking Increment increases the count by 1; 
clicking Decrement decreases it by 1 .
Console shows a message per click (e.g., "Increment clicked”).
The same Button component is reused for both actions.
