# Assignment 4 
Build a Theme Switcher App using React Context.
 
Create a ThemeContext with two themes: light and dark.
Wrap the app with ThemeContext.Provider.
Have a button “Toggle Theme” that switches between light and dark.
Display some text (e.g., “Hello Students!”) that changes style based on the active theme.
 
Light → white background, black text.
Dark → black background, white text.
